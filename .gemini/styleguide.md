# Part 1: Structure & Requirements

## Key Principles

### Readability, Maintainability, Consistency

- Code should be easy to understand for all team members
- Code should be easy to modify and extend
- Adhering to a consistent style across all projects improves collaboration and reduces errors

### No Browser Emulation

Do not use browser emulation tools like Selenium. Instead, replicate the necessary HTTP requests directly. This keeps collectors lightweight and avoids heavy dependencies.

### Return Only Actual Data

Collectors must return ONLY the collection dates explicitly provided by the council website. Never calculate or infer additional dates based on intervals, patterns, or statements like "and every other week thereafter". The collector's responsibility is to faithfully represent the data source, not to project or compute future dates.

### Keep Collectors Simple

Most collectors should be 200-400 lines. If approaching 500+ lines, it's a code smell indicating unnecessary complexity, bloated payloads, or single-use helpers.

---

## File Structure

- **New Collectors**: Place new council collector classes in `BinDays.Api.Collectors/Collectors/Councils/`
  - Filename must match the class name (e.g. `MyNewCouncil.cs`)

- **Integration Tests**: Corresponding integration tests for new collectors must be placed in `BinDays.Api.IntegrationTests/Collectors/Councils/`
  - Test filename should be `[CollectorName]Tests.cs` (e.g. `MyNewCouncilTests.cs`)

---

## Naming Conventions

- **Collector Classes**: Use PascalCase (e.g. `MyNewCouncil`)
- **Interfaces**: Use the `I` prefix (e.g. `ICollector`)
- **Methods and Properties**: Use PascalCase (e.g. `GetAddresses`, `WebsiteUrl`)
- **Private Fields**: Use `_camelCase` (e.g. `_binTypes`, `_client`)
- **Regex Methods**: Use PascalCase with "Regex" suffix (e.g. `TokenRegex()`, `AddressRegex()`, `BinDaysRegex()`)

---

## Property Implementation

- **Expression-Bodied Members**: Always use expression-bodied syntax (`=>`) for property getters, never full property blocks
- **Documentation**: Always use `/// <inheritdoc/>` for interface properties (`Name`, `WebsiteUrl`, `GovUkId`)
- **Uri Instantiation**: Use target-typed `new("url")` syntax for Uri properties

Example:

```c#
/// <inheritdoc/>
public string Name => "My New Council";

/// <inheritdoc/>
public Uri WebsiteUrl => new("https://www.mynewcouncil.gov.uk/");

/// <inheritdoc/>
public override string GovUkId => "my-new-council";
```

---

## Class Declaration

- **Access Modifier**: Always use `internal` for collector classes (not `public`)
- **Sealed**: Always declare collectors as `sealed` to prevent inheritance
- **Partial**: Use `partial` **only** when the class uses `[GeneratedRegex]` attributes
  - Standard collectors with regex: `internal sealed partial class`
  - Vendor base collectors without regex: `internal sealed class`
- **Inheritance**: All collectors inherit from `GovUkCollectorBase` (directly or through a vendor base class) and explicitly implement `ICollector`

Examples:

```c#
// Standard collector with regex - requires partial
internal sealed partial class MyNewCouncil : GovUkCollectorBase, ICollector

// Vendor base collector without regex - no partial needed
internal sealed class MyVendorCouncil : ITouchVisionCollectorBase, ICollector
```

---

## Class Member Ordering

Maintain consistent ordering of class members to improve code readability. Group **configuration** members together, followed by **implementation** members:

### Configuration (in this order):

1. **Interface Properties**:
   - `Name`
   - `WebsiteUrl`
   - `GovUkId` (or vendor-specific overrides for vendor base collectors)

2. **Bin Types**:
   - Standard collectors: `private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes`
   - Vendor collectors: `protected override IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> BinTypes`

3. **Private Const Fields** (if needed):
   - API keys, subscription keys, signatures, etc.
   - Use descriptive names like `_apiKey`, `_apiSubscriptionKey`, `_signature`
   - **Only keep constants used 2+ times**: If referenced only once, inline it directly
   - **Never use constants for bin names**: Bin names should be inline strings in `_binTypes`
   - Place all const fields together after bin types, before regex methods

**All private fields, const fields, and regex methods must have XML documentation (`/// <summary>`).**

### Implementation (in this order):

4. **Regex Methods** (if using `[GeneratedRegex]`):
   - Typical order: `TokenRegex()`, `AddressRegex()`, `BinDaysRegex()`
   - Other helper regexes as needed

5. **Interface Methods**:
   - `GetAddresses()`
   - `GetBinDays()`

6. **Helper Methods** (if needed):
   - Place at the end after interface methods
   - Always include XML documentation (`/// <summary>`)

### Example structure:

```c#
internal sealed partial class MyCouncil : GovUkCollectorBase, ICollector
{
    // === CONFIGURATION ===

    // Interface properties
    public string Name => "...";
    public Uri WebsiteUrl => new("...");
    public override string GovUkId => "...";

    /// <summary>
    /// The list of bin types for this collector.
    /// </summary>
    private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes = [...];

    /// <summary>
    /// The API key for the council's waste collection service.
    /// </summary>
    private const string _apiKey = "...";

    // === IMPLEMENTATION ===

    /// <summary>
    /// Regex to extract addresses from the HTML response.
    /// </summary>
    [GeneratedRegex(@"...")]
    private static partial Regex AddressRegex();

    // Interface methods
    public GetAddressesResponse GetAddresses(...) { ... }
    public GetBinDaysResponse GetBinDays(...) { ... }

    // Helper methods (if needed, and only if used 2-3+ times)
    /// <summary>
    /// Parses bin collection data from the API response.
    /// </summary>
    private List<BinDay> ParseBinData(...) { ... }
}
```

## Core Design Philosophy

### Stateless Design

Because all requests to council websites originate from the client application (the user's device), the API itself is stateless. This means you cannot save state, such as authentication tokens or session cookies, between the different steps of a collector's process (e.g. between `GetAddresses` and `GetBinDays`). Each step is an independent transaction.

### Managing State Across Request Steps

While the collector itself is stateless, you often need to pass data (tokens, cookies, session IDs) between client-side request steps. Use the `ClientSideOptions.Metadata` dictionary to carry this state forward:

```c#
// Store state in first request
Options = new ClientSideOptions
{
    Metadata =
    {
        { "cookie", cookie },
        { "csrfToken", token },
    },
};

// Retrieve state in subsequent request
var cookie = clientSideResponse.Options.Metadata["cookie"];
var token = clientSideResponse.Options.Metadata["csrfToken"];
```

**Important guidelines for metadata:**

- **Only store necessary data**: Don't add metadata keys that aren't used in subsequent requests
- **Expect required values**: If metadata is needed for the next step, expect it to exist and use the null-forgiving operator (`!`)
- **Avoid unnecessary keys**: Don't store values that can be easily derived or aren't needed

### Step-by-Step Request Implementation

For collectors that require multiple client-side requests, use a step-by-step implementation based on the `RequestId` of the `clientSideResponse`. This is typically structured as an `if/else if` chain.

- **RequestId Numbering**: Always start RequestId at `1` (not `0`) and increment sequentially
- **Initial Request Pattern**: Always start with `if (clientSideResponse == null)` for the initial client-side request
- **Subsequent Requests**: Use `else if (clientSideResponse.RequestId == X)` for each step in the flow
- **Fallthrough Handler**: Always end with `throw new InvalidOperationException("Invalid client-side request.");`
- **Comment Style**: Use clear, specific comments before each block
- **Preserve Existing Logic**: Do not refactor the existing `if/else if` structure—this pattern is intentional

### Intentionally Brittle Design

Collectors are intentionally designed to be "brittle"—they are expected to fail loudly and quickly if the council's website changes or if the data format is not what is expected.

- **Avoid `try/catch` blocks**: Do not wrap parsing logic in `try/catch` blocks to handle nulls or formatting issues silently
- **Let the code raise exceptions**: `NullReferenceException`, `FormatException`, etc., should propagate
- **Why?** This ensures errors are not hidden. When a collector fails, the error is captured and logged at a higher level with a clear stack trace
- **Custom Exceptions**: For predictable, high-level failures (e.g. postcode not found), create and throw a custom exception (e.g. `GovUkIdNotFoundException`)

---

# Part 2: Implementation Guidelines (Do's and Don'ts)

## HTTP Headers

### ❌ DON'T: Include excessive browser-specific headers

**Problem**: Too many browser-specific headers make the collector brittle and heavyweight.

```c#
Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
    { "accept", "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8" },
    { "accept-language", "en-US,en;q=0.9" },
    { "sec-ch-ua", "\"Not A(Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Mozilla\";v=\"137\", \"Chromium\";v=\"137\"" },
    { "sec-ch-ua-mobile", "?0" },
    { "upgrade-insecure-requests", "1" },
},
```

### ✅ DO: Use minimal, essential headers only

**Reason**: `ClientSideRequest.Headers` defaults to `{ "user-agent": Constants.UserAgent }`. For simple GET requests, omit `Headers` entirely — the default is sufficient.

```c#
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    RequestId = 1,
    Url = requestUrl,
    Method = "GET",
};
```

**When additional headers are needed, include user-agent explicitly (setting `Headers` replaces the default):**

```c#
Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
    { "content-type", Constants.ApplicationJson },
},
```

**Use `Constants.FormUrlEncoded` for form posts and `Constants.XmlHttpRequest` for AJAX requests:**

```c#
Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
    { "content-type", Constants.FormUrlEncoded },
    { "x-requested-with", Constants.XmlHttpRequest },
},
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use old-style Dictionary initialization

**Problem**: Using `new Dictionary<string, string>()` instead of target-typed `new()`.

```c#
var requestHeaders = new Dictionary<string, string> {
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
};
```

### ✅ DO: Use target-typed new() for dictionaries

**Reason**: More concise and consistent with modern C# style.

```c#
Dictionary<string, string> requestHeaders = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
    { "content-type", Constants.FormUrlEncoded },
};
```

### Handling Bot Protection

Some council websites use bot-detection that blocks requests which don't resemble browser traffic. Since all requests originate from users' residential IPs (not server IPs), the IP itself should not trigger bot protection — the issue is usually that the request _looks_ automated because it lacks typical browser headers.

**Why headers matter**: Bot-protection systems (Cloudflare, AWS WAF, Akamai, etc.) check whether incoming requests match the fingerprint of a real browser. The main signals are: HTTP headers (presence, values, and consistency), TLS fingerprint (JA3/JA4), and HTTP/2 settings. Since our requests are executed by the mobile app's native HTTP stack from residential IPs, the TLS fingerprint and HTTP/2 settings are naturally legitimate — headers are the main thing we control.

**Strategy: add headers incrementally** — start minimal and only add what is needed to unblock the request. Do not cargo-cult a full browser header set.

**Step 1 — Try with just `user-agent` first** (the default). Most councils don't need anything else.

**Step 2 — If blocked, add `accept`, `accept-language`, and `accept-encoding`** to signal that the client is a real browser:

```c#
Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
    { "accept", "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8" },
    { "accept-language", "en-GB,en;q=0.5" },
    { "accept-encoding", "gzip, deflate, br" },
},
```

**Step 3 — If still blocked, add `referer` and `upgrade-insecure-requests`** to mimic in-site navigation. The referer should point to the previous step's URL. `upgrade-insecure-requests: 1` is sent by all browsers on navigation requests:

```c#
{ "referer", "https://www.example-council.gov.uk/bins" },
{ "upgrade-insecure-requests", "1" },
```

**Step 4 — If still blocked, add `sec-fetch-*` navigation headers.** These are Fetch Metadata headers that browsers attach to top-level navigations. Their presence (combined with the correct values) signals a real user clicking a link, which most bot-protection middleware trusts:

```c#
Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
    { "accept", "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8" },
    { "accept-language", "en-GB,en;q=0.5" },
    { "accept-encoding", "gzip, deflate, br" },
    { "referer", previousStepUrl },
    { "upgrade-insecure-requests", "1" },
    { "sec-fetch-dest", "document" },
    { "sec-fetch-mode", "navigate" },
    { "sec-fetch-site", "same-origin" },
    { "sec-fetch-user", "?1" },
},
```

**Sec-Fetch values vary by request type:**

| Scenario                       | `sec-fetch-dest` | `sec-fetch-mode` | `sec-fetch-site` | `sec-fetch-user` |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| First navigation (no referrer) | `document`       | `navigate`       | `none`           | `?1`             |
| In-site navigation             | `document`       | `navigate`       | `same-origin`    | `?1`             |
| AJAX/fetch request             | `empty`          | `cors`           | `same-origin`    | _(omit)_         |

**Never include `sec-ch-ua` Client Hints headers.** We always use a Firefox user-agent (`Constants.UserAgent`), and Firefox does not send Client Hints. Including them contradicts the claimed browser identity and is itself a bot-detection signal:

```c#
// ❌ DON'T: Firefox never sends these — their presence flags the request as spoofed.
{ "sec-ch-ua", "\"Not A(Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Google Chrome\";v=\"120\"" },
{ "sec-ch-ua-mobile", "?0" },
{ "sec-ch-ua-platform", "\"Windows\"" },
```

**Headers that are safe to skip**: `dnt`, `pragma`, `cache-control`, `te`, `priority` — these are not primary detection signals and add noise without benefit.

---

## Request Bodies & JSON Payloads

### ❌ DON'T: Include unnecessary fields in request bodies

**Problem**: Bloated payloads with empty strings, null values, default values, or false booleans.

```c#
Body = $$"""
{
    "postcode": "{{postcode}}",
    "uprn": "{{uprn}}",
    "timestamp": "{{DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds()}}",
    "source": "",
    "validate": false,
    "returnAll": null,
    "locale": ""
}
""",
```

### ✅ DO: Use minimal request bodies

**Reason**: Remove all unnecessary fields. Only include what the API actually requires.

```c#
Body = $$"""
{
    "postcode": "{{postcode}}",
    "uprn": "{{uprn}}"
}
""",
```

### ✅ DO: Verify request body fields are actually required

**Reason**: Council APIs often ignore most fields in a request body. When implementing a new collector, test by progressively removing fields and running integration tests. Use binary search (remove half the fields at once) to efficiently find the minimal set.

**Strategy:**

1. Start with the full request body observed from the council website
2. Remove obvious candidates first: `stopOnFailure`, `usePHPIntegrations`, `isPublished`, `formName`, `formUri`, and other metadata-like fields
3. Remove fields in batches and run integration tests after each removal
4. Keep only the fields that cause test failures when removed

This often leads to dramatic reductions — a request body with 15+ fields may only need 2-3.

### ❌ DON'T: Build JSON using nested dictionaries

**Problem**: Nested dictionaries are verbose and hard to read.

```c#
var payload = JsonSerializer.Serialize(new Dictionary<string, object>
{
    { "formId", formId },
    { "sessionId", sessionId },
    { "formValues", new Dictionary<string, string>
        {
            { "postcode", postcode },
            { "uprn", uprn }
        }
    }
});
```

### ✅ DO: Use raw string literals for JSON

**Reason**: Raw string literals with interpolation are more readable and maintainable.

```c#
var payload = $$"""
{
    "formId": "{{formId}}",
    "sessionId": "{{sessionId}}",
    "formValues": {
        "postcode": "{{postcode}}",
        "uprn": "{{uprn}}"
    }
}
""";
```

---

## Bin Type Configuration

### ❌ DON'T: Use generic bin names

**Problem**: Names that only describe the container type/color, not the contents.

```c#
private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes =
[
    new()
    {
        Name = "Recycling (Green Box)",
        Colour = BinColour.Green,
        Keys = [ "Recycling" ],
        Type = BinType.Box,
    },
];
```

### ✅ DO: Use descriptive bin names

**Reason**: Names should describe what goes in the bin, not just the container.

```c#
private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes =
[
    new()
    {
        Name = "Paper, Glass & Cardboard Recycling",
        Colour = BinColour.Green,
        Keys = [ "Recycling" ],
        Type = BinType.Box,
    },
];
```

### ❌ DON'T: Include unnecessary keys

**Problem**: Multiple keys when only one is actually needed for matching.

```c#
Keys = [ "Residual", "Refuse", "General" ],
```

### ✅ DO: Include only keys that are actually matched

**Reason**: Only add keys that will actually be matched against the data source.

```c#
Keys = [ "General Waste" ],
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use broad keys that match multiple bin types

**Problem**: A key that is too broad can match dates belonging to a different bin type, causing incorrect collection dates. For example, using `"Recycling"` as a key for a paper/glass recycling bin would also match food waste recycling entries, assigning the wrong dates.

```c#
// ❌ "Recycling" matches both "Recycling" and "Food Waste Recycling"
new() { Name = "Paper & Card Recycling", Keys = [ "Recycling" ] },
new() { Name = "Food Waste", Keys = [ "Food Waste Recycling" ] },
```

### ✅ DO: Use the most specific key possible — prefer one key per bin type

**Reason**: Use the exact string from the data source. If a single specific key uniquely identifies the bin type, use only that one key. Only add multiple keys when the data source genuinely uses different strings for the same bin type across different addresses or responses.

```c#
// ✅ Each key uniquely identifies its bin type
new() { Name = "Paper & Card Recycling", Keys = [ "Paper and Card" ] },
new() { Name = "Food Waste", Keys = [ "Food Waste" ] },
```

### ✅ Exception: Intentional shared keys for co-collected bins

**When it's valid**: Some councils collect multiple bin types on the same day but only report one `collectionType` in the API response. In these cases it is correct and intentional for multiple bin entries to share the same key, so that all co-collected bins appear on the same date.

**How to identify this pattern**: The council website lists e.g. "Food Waste" under the same collection heading as "Recycling", but the API only returns a single `"Recycling"` entry (no separate `"Food"` or `"Food Waste"` entry exists in the response).

```c#
// ✅ Food waste is co-collected on recycling day — API never returns a separate "Food" entry
new() { Name = "Recycling", Keys = [ "Recycling" ] },
new() { Name = "Food Waste", Keys = [ "Recycling" ], Type = BinType.Caddy },
```

**Important**: Only use this pattern when you have verified (by inspecting the actual API response) that the data source does not return a separate entry for the co-collected bin. Do not add keys from other bin types speculatively — verify the API response first. Also do not add dead keys for values the API never returns (e.g. `"Food"` when the API only ever returns `"Recycling"`).

---

### ❌ DON'T: Extract bin names as constants

**Problem**: Creating constants for bin names adds unnecessary code.

```c#
private const string _rubbishBinName = "General Waste";

private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes =
[
    new()
    {
        Name = _rubbishBinName,  // ❌
        Colour = BinColour.Black,
    },
];
```

### ✅ DO: Inline bin names

**Reason**: Bin names should be inline strings in the `_binTypes` collection.

```c#
private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes =
[
    new()
    {
        Name = "General Waste",  // ✅
        Colour = BinColour.Black,
    },
];
```

### ❌ DON'T: Explicitly set default Type value

**Problem**: Setting `Type = BinType.Bin` when it's the default.

```c#
new()
{
    Name = "General Waste",
    Colour = BinColour.Black,
    Type = BinType.Bin,  // ❌ This is the default
},
```

### ✅ DO: Omit default Type value

**Reason**: `BinType.Bin` is the default value, so it can be omitted.

```c#
new()
{
    Name = "General Waste",
    Colour = BinColour.Black,
    // No Type property needed - defaults to BinType.Bin
},
```

---

## Postcode Handling

### ❌ DON'T: Format the postcode in collectors

**Problem**: Calling `FormatPostcode()` inside the collector implementation.

```c#
public GetAddressesResponse GetAddresses(string postcode, ClientSideResponse? clientSideResponse)
{
    if (clientSideResponse == null)
    {
        postcode = ProcessingUtilities.FormatPostcode(postcode);  // ❌ Don't do this
        // ...
    }
}
```

### ✅ DO: Use the postcode as-is

**Reason**: The postcode is already formatted before the collector method is called. Use it directly.

```c#
public GetAddressesResponse GetAddresses(string postcode, ClientSideResponse? clientSideResponse)
{
    if (clientSideResponse == null)
    {
        // Use postcode directly - it's already formatted
        var url = $"https://api.example.com?postcode={postcode}";
        // ...
    }
}
```

### ❌ DON'T: Extract postcode from address data

**Problem**: Parsing the postcode from raw address strings when it's already provided.

```c#
var fullAddress = addressElement.GetProperty("fullAddress").GetString()!;
var extractedPostcode = Regex.Match(fullAddress, @"[A-Z]{1,2}\d{1,2}\s?\d[A-Z]{2}").Value;  // ❌

var address = new Address
{
    Property = fullAddress,
    Postcode = extractedPostcode,  // ❌ Don't extract it
    Uid = uid,
};
```

### ✅ DO: Use the postcode parameter

**Reason**: The postcode is passed as a parameter - use it directly.

```c#
var fullAddress = addressElement.GetProperty("fullAddress").GetString()!;

var address = new Address
{
    Property = fullAddress,
    Postcode = postcode,  // ✅ Use the parameter
    Uid = uid,
};
```

---

## Metadata Management

### ❌ DON'T: Store unnecessary metadata

**Problem**: Storing values in metadata that aren't used in subsequent requests.

```c#
Options = new ClientSideOptions
{
    Metadata =
    {
        { "postcode", formattedPostcode },  // Not used later
        { "requestTime", DateTime.UtcNow.ToString() },  // Not used later
        { "originalInput", postcode },  // Not used later
    },
},
```

### ✅ DO: Only store metadata that's needed later

**Reason**: Metadata should only contain values required for subsequent requests.

```c#
Options = new ClientSideOptions
{
    Metadata =
    {
        { "csrfToken", token },  // ✅ Used in next request
        { "sessionId", sessionId },  // ✅ Used in next request
    },
},
```

### ❌ DON'T: Initialize empty metadata explicitly

**Problem**: Creating empty metadata dictionaries unnecessarily.

```c#
Options = new ClientSideOptions
{
    Metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>(),  // ❌ Unnecessary
},
```

### ✅ DO: Omit Options/Metadata if not needed

**Reason**: Properties with default values should be omitted entirely.

```c#
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    RequestId = 1,
    Url = "https://example.com",
    Method = "GET",
    // No Options property at all if no metadata needed
};
```

### ❌ DON'T: Make required metadata optional

**Problem**: Using conditional logic when metadata should always exist.

```c#
var cookie = clientSideResponse.Options.Metadata.ContainsKey("cookie")
    ? clientSideResponse.Options.Metadata["cookie"]
    : string.Empty;
```

### ✅ DO: Expect required metadata to exist

**Reason**: If metadata is needed for the next step, it should always be there. Fail fast if it's missing.

```c#
var cookie = clientSideResponse.Options.Metadata["cookie"];
```

---

## Null Handling & Required Values

### ❌ DON'T: Use null-coalescing for required values

**Problem**: Silently using fallback values when data should be required.

```c#
var postcode = address.Postcode ?? string.Empty;
var uid = address.Uid ?? "unknown";

var cookies = clientSideResponse.Headers.TryGetValue("set-cookie", out var h)
    ? ProcessingUtilities.ParseSetCookieHeaderForRequestCookie(h)
    : string.Empty;
```

### ✅ DO: Use null-forgiving operator for required values

**Reason**: Let the collector fail fast with clear errors if required data is missing.

```c#
var postcode = address.Postcode!;
var uid = address.Uid!;

var setCookieHeader = clientSideResponse.Headers["set-cookie"];
var cookies = ProcessingUtilities.ParseSetCookieHeaderForRequestCookie(setCookieHeader);
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use TryGetValue for required headers

**Problem**: TryGetValue with null-forgiving operator is unnecessarily verbose for headers that must exist.

```c#
clientSideResponse.Headers.TryGetValue("set-cookie", out var setCookieHeader);
var requestCookies = ProcessingUtilities.ParseSetCookieHeaderForRequestCookie(setCookieHeader!);
```

### ✅ DO: Use direct header indexer access

**Reason**: Simpler and fails fast with a clear `KeyNotFoundException` if the header is missing.

```c#
var setCookieHeader = clientSideResponse.Headers["set-cookie"];
var requestCookies = ProcessingUtilities.ParseSetCookieHeaderForRequestCookie(setCookieHeader);
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use defensive fallback for expected JSON properties

**Problem**: Making optional what should be required.

```c#
if (data.TryGetProperty("uprn", out var uprnElement))
{
    uid = uprnElement.GetString() ?? "fallback";
}
else
{
    uid = data.GetProperty("name").GetString();  // Fallback
}
```

### ✅ DO: Expect required properties and fail fast

**Reason**: If data should always exist, don't handle the missing case.

```c#
var uid = data.GetProperty("uprn").GetString()!;
```

## Code Formatting & Style

### ❌ DON'T: Forget trailing commas

**Problem**: Missing trailing commas in multi-line initializers.

```c#
private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes =
[
    new()
    {
        Name = "General Waste",
        Colour = BinColour.Black,
        Keys = [ "General" ]  // ❌ Missing comma
    }
];

Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent }  // ❌ Missing comma
};
```

### ✅ DO: Always use trailing commas in multi-line initializers

**Reason**: Makes future diffs cleaner and reduces merge conflicts.

**Single-line collections do NOT need internal trailing commas** — only the line itself needs one if it's inside a multi-line context. Trailing commas inside `[ ]` are only needed when the collection spans multiple lines.

```c#
private readonly IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> _binTypes =
[
    new()
    {
        Name = "General Waste",
        Colour = BinColour.Black,
        Keys = [ "General" ],  // ✅ Single-item list, no comma inside brackets
    },
];

// Multi-line collection — each element gets a trailing comma:
Keys =
[
    "General Waste",
    "Non-Recyclable",
],

Headers = new()
{
    { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },  // ✅ Has comma
};
```

### ❌ DON'T: Call DateOnly.ParseExact directly

**Problem**: Verbose boilerplate — always requires `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` and `DateTimeStyles.None`.

```c#
var date = DateOnly.ParseExact(
    dateString,
    "dd/MM/yyyy",
    CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
    DateTimeStyles.None
);
```

### ✅ DO: Use DateUtilities.ParseDateExact

**Reason**: Removes boilerplate; the utility class owns all date parsing concerns.

```c#
var date = DateUtilities.ParseDateExact(dateString, "dd/MM/yyyy");
```

### ❌ DON'T: Put closing parenthesis inline with the last argument

**Problem**: Closing parenthesis on the same line as the last argument is harder to read.

```c#
var date = DateOnly.ParseExact(
    dateString,
    "dd/MM/yyyy",
    CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
    DateTimeStyles.None);  // ❌ Should be on own line
```

### ✅ DO: Put closing parenthesis on its own line

**Reason**: Consistent formatting for multi-line method calls.

```c#
var date = DateOnly.ParseExact(
    dateString,
    "dd/MM/yyyy",
    CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
    DateTimeStyles.None
);  // ✅ On its own line
```

### ❌ DON'T: Include unused using statements

**Problem**: Importing namespaces that aren't used in the file.

```c#
using BinDays.Api.Collectors.Collectors.Vendors;  // Not used
using System.Linq;  // Not used
using System.Web;  // Legacy, should use System.Net
```

### ✅ DO: Remove unused using statements

**Reason**: Keeps code clean and reduces clutter.

```c#
// Only include what you actually use
using BinDays.Api.Collectors.Models;
using BinDays.Api.Collectors.Utilities;
using System.Net;  // Use modern WebUtility, not System.Web.HttpUtility
```

### ❌ DON'T: Return inline without separate variable

**Problem**: Returning objects inline makes debugging harder.

```c#
return new GetAddressesResponse {
    NextClientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest {
        RequestId = 1
    }
};
```

### ✅ DO: Use separate variable declarations

**Reason**: Improves readability and makes debugging easier.

```c#
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    RequestId = 1,
    Url = "https://example.com",
};

var response = new GetAddressesResponse
{
    NextClientSideRequest = clientSideRequest
};

return response;
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use partial keyword without GeneratedRegex

**Problem**: Declaring class as partial when it doesn't use regex.

```c#
internal sealed partial class MyCouncil : GovUkCollectorBase, ICollector
{
    // No [GeneratedRegex] attributes anywhere
}
```

### ✅ DO: Only use partial for classes with GeneratedRegex

**Reason**: The partial keyword is only needed when using `[GeneratedRegex]` attributes.

```c#
// Without regex - no partial needed
internal sealed class MyCouncil : GovUkCollectorBase, ICollector

// With regex - partial required
internal sealed partial class MyCouncil : GovUkCollectorBase, ICollector
{
    [GeneratedRegex(@"<option value=""(?<uid>[^""]+)"">")]
    private static partial Regex AddressRegex();
}
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use local functions (methods declared inside methods)

**Problem**: Local functions add nesting and make the control flow harder to follow.

```c#
var binDays = new List<BinDay>();
foreach (var row in rows)
{
    var service = results["TaskTypeName"];

    void AddBinDay(string dateString)
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(dateString)) return;
        var date = DateUtilities.ParseDateExact(dateString, "yyyy-MM-dd");
        binDays.Add(new BinDay { Date = date, Bins = matchedBins });
    }

    AddBinDay(results["NextInstance"]);
    AddBinDay(results["LastInstance"]);
}
```

### ✅ DO: Use a loop instead of a local function

**Reason**: A simple loop over the values is flatter and easier to read.

```c#
var binDays = new List<BinDay>();
foreach (var row in rows)
{
    var service = results["TaskTypeName"];
    var matchedBins = ProcessingUtilities.GetMatchingBins(_binTypes, service);

    foreach (var dateString in new[] { results["NextInstance"], results["LastInstance"] })
    {
        if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(dateString))
        {
            continue;
        }

        binDays.Add(new BinDay
        {
            Date = DateUtilities.ParseDateExact(dateString, "yyyy-MM-dd"),
            Address = address,
            Bins = matchedBins,
        });
    }
}
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use single-line if statements

**Problem**: Putting the body on the same line as the `if` is easy to miss when scanning code.

```c#
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(dateString)) continue;
if (value == null) return;
```

### ✅ DO: Always use braces for if statements

**Reason**: Braces make control flow explicit and prevent bugs when adding lines later.

```c#
if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(dateString))
{
    continue;
}

if (value == null)
{
    return;
}
```

---

## Helper Methods & Code Duplication

### ❌ DON'T: Create single-use helper methods

**Problem**: Extracting methods that are only called once for "organization".

```c#
private static Dictionary<string, object> BuildAddressSearchBody(string postcode)
{
    var body = new Dictionary<string, object>
    {
        { "postcode", postcode },
        { "search", true }
    };
    return body;
}

// Called only once
var requestBody = JsonSerializer.Serialize(BuildAddressSearchBody(postcode));
```

### ✅ DO: Inline single-use code

**Reason**: Single-use helpers make the code harder to follow, not easier.

```c#
// Inline where it's used
var requestBody = $$"""
{
    "postcode": "{{postcode}}",
    "search": true
}
""";
```

### ❌ DON'T: Create helpers without documentation

**Problem**: Helper methods missing XML documentation.

```c#
private static string ProcessDateString(string input)
{
    return input.Trim().Replace("st", "").Replace("nd", "");
}
```

### ✅ DO: Add XML documentation to helpers

**Reason**: All helper methods require XML documentation.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Removes ordinal suffixes from date strings.
/// </summary>
private static string ProcessDateString(string input)
{
    return input.Trim().Replace("st", "").Replace("nd", "");
}
```

### ✅ DO: Extract truly duplicated logic (2-3+ uses)

**Reason**: Helpers should reduce duplication when code is used multiple times.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Creates the initial client-side request for session initialization.
/// </summary>
private ClientSideRequest CreateInitialRequest()
{
    return new ClientSideRequest
    {
        RequestId = 1,
        Url = "https://example.com/form",
        Method = "GET",
    };
}

// Used in both GetAddresses and GetBinDays
var clientSideRequest = CreateInitialRequest();
```

---

## Collector Complexity

### ❌ DON'T: Create overly complex collectors

**Problem**: Collector implementations that are 500+ lines long indicate a code smell.

**Red flags that indicate unnecessary complexity:**

- Single-use helper methods
- Excessive comments explaining convoluted logic
- Multiple retry mechanisms
- Complex state tracking across requests
- Defensive null checks and fallback logic
- Building JSON with nested Dictionary structures
- Duplicate code between GetAddresses and GetBinDays

### ✅ DO: Keep collectors simple and focused

**Reason**: Most collectors should be 200-400 lines. If it's much longer, look for unnecessary complexity.

**How to reduce complexity:**

1. **Remove bloated request bodies** - Strip unnecessary fields (verify each field is required by testing removal)
2. **Eliminate unnecessary request steps** - If a step fetches a token or value that subsequent steps don't actually need, remove the entire step. Test by removing the value from the downstream request body first; if it still works, the fetch step can be deleted entirely
3. **Strip URL query parameters** - Remove empty, default, null-like, cache-buster, and logging parameters from URLs
4. **Inline single-use helpers** - Don't extract methods used once
5. **Use raw string literals** - Replace nested Dictionary structures
6. **Avoid over-engineering** - Don't add retry logic, caching, or defensive fallbacks unless strictly required
7. **Minimize metadata** - Only store what's needed for subsequent requests
8. **Keep UIDs minimal** - Only store values in the `Uid` that are actually used by `GetBinDays`. Don't store every field from the address response just because it's available
9. **Extract truly common logic** - Only create helpers for genuine duplication (2-3+ uses)

### ✅ DO: Verify everything by iterative removal and testing

**Reason**: Council APIs are often far more lenient than they appear from browser network traffic. The original request captured from a council website may include dozens of fields, parameters, headers, and even entire request steps that are completely ignored by the server.

**Apply this minimization strategy to every aspect of the collector:**

| What to minimize     | How to test                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Request body fields  | Remove fields one-by-one or in batches, run integration tests                                  |
| URL query parameters | Strip all except obvious IDs, add back only what fails                                         |
| HTTP headers         | Start with just `content-type` and `cookie`, add only what's needed                            |
| Request steps        | Remove a value from downstream request bodies; if still works, delete the fetch step entirely  |
| UID fields           | Remove fields from the `GetBinDays` request body to find which address data is actually needed |

**Real-world example**: A collector copied from browser traffic had 4 request steps, 15+ request body fields, 6 URL query parameters, and a 9-field UID. After iterative testing, it was reduced to 2 request steps, 1-2 request body fields, 0 extra URL query parameters, and a single-field UID. The file went from 430+ lines to ~260 lines.

---

## Constants & Configuration

### ❌ DON'T: Create constants for single-use values

**Problem**: Creating constants that are only referenced once.

```c#
private const string _pageUrl = "https://www.example.com/bins";

// Used only once
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    Url = _pageUrl,
};
```

### ✅ DO: Inline values used only once

**Reason**: Constants should only exist for values used 2+ times.

```c#
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    Url = "https://www.example.com/bins",
};
```

### ✅ DO: Create constants for repeated values

**Reason**: DRY principle applies when a value is used multiple times.

```c#
private const string _apiKey = "abc123xyz";

// Used in multiple requests
Headers = new() { { "x-api-key", _apiKey }, };
// ... later
Headers = new() { { "x-api-key", _apiKey }, };
```

### ✅ DO: Use the shared header constants from `Constants`

**Reason**: Avoids magic strings for common header values. The following are available in `BinDays.Api.Collectors.Utilities.Constants`:

- `Constants.UserAgent` — the Firefox user-agent string
- `Constants.FormUrlEncoded` — `"application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`
- `Constants.ApplicationJson` — `"application/json"`
- `Constants.XmlHttpRequest` — `"XMLHttpRequest"` (value for `x-requested-with`)

`ClientSideRequest.Headers` defaults to `{ "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent }`. Only set `Headers` explicitly when additional headers are required — setting it replaces the default entirely, so user-agent must then be included manually.

```c#
// ✅ Simple GET — no Headers needed, default provides user-agent
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    RequestId = 1,
    Url = requestUrl,
    Method = "GET",
};

// ✅ POST with content-type — must re-include user-agent
var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    RequestId = 2,
    Url = requestUrl,
    Method = "POST",
    Headers = new()
    {
        { "user-agent", Constants.UserAgent },
        { "content-type", Constants.FormUrlEncoded },
    },
    Body = requestBody,
};
```

### ✅ DO: Use HTTPS URLs when available

**Reason**: More secure and avoids unnecessary redirects.

```c#
// ❌ DON'T
public Uri WebsiteUrl => new("http://www.example.gov.uk/");

// ✅ DO
public Uri WebsiteUrl => new("https://www.example.gov.uk/");
```

---

## Date Parsing

### ❌ DON'T: Use fragile string manipulation

**Problem**: Using `Split` or other string operations that can break easily.

```c#
var day = dateText.Split(' ')[0];  // Breaks if format changes
```

### ✅ DO: Use regex for extracting date parts

**Reason**: More robust when format varies slightly.

```c#
var day = Regex.Match(dateText, @"\d+").Value;
```

### ❌ DON'T: Forget to remove ordinal suffixes

**Problem**: Parsing dates with "1st", "2nd", "3rd" without removing suffixes.

```c#
var date = DateUtilities.ParseDateExact("21st March 2024", "dd MMMM yyyy");  // ❌ Will fail
```

### ✅ DO: Remove ordinal suffixes before parsing

**Reason**: UK councils frequently use ordinal date formats.

```c#
[GeneratedRegex(@"(?<=\d)(st|nd|rd|th)")]
private static partial Regex OrdinalSuffixRegex();

// Remove suffixes first
dateString = OrdinalSuffixRegex().Replace(dateString, "");
var date = DateUtilities.ParseDateExact(dateString, "d MMMM yyyy");
```

### ✅ DO: Use the correct DateUtilities method for the date format

**Reason**: Each method enforces the right format contract at the boundary and redirects misuse with a clear error.

| Method                         | Format contains year? | Handles Today/Tomorrow? |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `ParseDateExact`               | ✅ required           | ❌                      |
| `ParseRelativeDateOrExact`     | ✅ required           | ✅                      |
| `ParseRelativeDateOrInferYear` | ❌ forbidden          | ✅                      |
| `ParseDateInferringYear`       | ❌ forbidden          | ❌                      |

```c#
// Full date with year
var date = DateUtilities.ParseDateExact(dateString, "dd/MM/yyyy");

// Full date with year, but council may also return "Today" or "Tomorrow"
var date = DateUtilities.ParseRelativeDateOrExact(dateString, "dddd d MMMM yyyy");

// Date without year, but council may also return "Today" or "Tomorrow"
var date = DateUtilities.ParseRelativeDateOrInferYear(dateString, "dddd d MMMM");

// Date without year
var date = DateUtilities.ParseDateInferringYear(dateString, "dddd d MMMM");
```

---

## Regular Expressions

### ❌ DON'T: Access regex groups by index

**Problem**: Using numeric indexes instead of named capture groups.

```c#
[GeneratedRegex(@"sid=([^&]+)")]
private static partial Regex SidRegex();

// Later...
var sid = SidRegex().Match(content).Groups[1].Value;  // ❌ Using index
```

### ✅ DO: Use named capture groups

**Reason**: More readable and maintainable. Safer if regex changes.

```c#
[GeneratedRegex(@"sid=(?<sid>[^&]+)")]
private static partial Regex SidRegex();

// Later...
var sid = SidRegex().Match(content).Groups["sid"].Value;  // ✅ Using name
```

### ❌ DON'T: Forget null-forgiving operator on Matches

**Problem**: Not using `!` on regex `Matches()` calls.

```c#
var rawAddresses = AddressRegex().Matches(content);  // ❌ Missing !
```

### ✅ DO: Use null-forgiving operator on Matches

**Reason**: Ensures failures propagate clearly per the "fail fast" philosophy.

```c#
var rawAddresses = AddressRegex().Matches(content)!;  // ✅ Has !
```

### ❌ DON'T: Leave unused regex methods

**Problem**: Defining `[GeneratedRegex]` methods that aren't used.

```c#
[GeneratedRegex(@"month:\s*(?<month>\w+)")]
private static partial Regex MonthSectionRegex();  // Never used!
```

### ✅ DO: Remove unused regex methods

**Reason**: Keeps code clean and avoids confusion.

```c#
// Only define regex methods that are actually used in the code
[GeneratedRegex(@"<option value=""(?<uid>[^""]+)"">")]
private static partial Regex AddressRegex();  // ✅ Actually used
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use dynamic regex patterns

**Problem**: Creating regex patterns at runtime or using Regex.Replace/Match with string patterns.

```c#
// Building pattern at runtime
var pattern = $@"<div class=""{className}"">(.*?)</div>";
var match = Regex.Match(content, pattern);  // ❌ Not using GeneratedRegex

// Or using Regex.Replace directly
var cleaned = Regex.Replace(dateString, @"\d+(st|nd|rd|th)", "");  // ❌ Not using GeneratedRegex
```

### ✅ DO: Use GeneratedRegex for all patterns

**Reason**: Better performance and compile-time validation.

```c#
// Define all patterns as GeneratedRegex
[GeneratedRegex(@"<div class=""[^""]*"">(.*?)</div>")]
private static partial Regex ContentRegex();

[GeneratedRegex(@"\d+(st|nd|rd|th)")]
private static partial Regex OrdinalRegex();

// Use the generated methods
var match = ContentRegex().Match(content);  // ✅
var cleaned = OrdinalRegex().Replace(dateString, "");  // ✅
```

---

## Address Handling

### ❌ DON'T: Use complex if statements for address building

**Problem**: Multiple if statements to conditionally build address parts.

```c#
var property = addressParts[0];
if (addressParts.Length > 1)
{
    property += ", " + addressParts[1];
}
if (addressParts.Length > 2)
{
    property += ", " + addressParts[2];
}
```

### ✅ DO: Use string.Join with Where filter

**Reason**: More concise and handles empty/whitespace values automatically.

```c#
var property = string.Join(", ", addressParts.Where(p => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(p)));
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use nested ternary operators

**Problem**: Hard to read and understand.

```c#
Town = addressParts.Length > 3
    ? addressParts[2]
    : addressParts.Length > 2
        ? addressParts[1]
        : null,
```

### ✅ DO: Use switch expressions

**Reason**: More readable and maintainable.

```c#
Town = addressParts.Length switch
{
    > 3 => addressParts[2],
    > 2 => addressParts[1],
    _ => null,
},
```

### ❌ DON'T: Split addresses unnecessarily

**Problem**: Extracting Street and Town when not required by the API.

```c#
var address = new Address
{
    Property = addressParts[0],
    Street = addressParts.Length > 1 ? addressParts[1] : null,
    Town = addressParts.Length > 2 ? addressParts[2] : null,
    Postcode = postcode,
    Uid = uid,
};
```

### ✅ DO: Use Property field for full address

**Reason**: Simpler and more accurate unless API requires separate fields.

```c#
var address = new Address
{
    Property = fullAddressString,  // Include everything here
    Postcode = postcode,
    Uid = uid,
    // Omit Street and Town unless API strictly requires them
};
```

### ❌ DON'T: Sort addresses

**Problem**: Unnecessarily sorting addresses by property name.

```c#
Addresses = addresses.OrderBy(address => address.Property).ToList(),
```

### ✅ DO: Return addresses in order received

**Reason**: Addresses should be returned in the order from the API.

```c#
Addresses = [.. addresses],
```

### ✅ DO: Keep UIDs minimal

**Reason**: Only store values in the `Uid` that `GetBinDays` actually needs. If the bin days API only requires a UPRN, store just the UPRN — don't concatenate every field from the address response. Verify what's needed by testing field removal in the `GetBinDays` request body first.

```c#
// ✅ GetBinDays only needs UPRN
Uid = results["uprn"],

// ❌ Storing 9 fields when only UPRN is used
Uid = $"{uprn};{usrn};{house};{street};{locality};{town};{county};{postcode};{blpu}",
```

### ✅ DO: Concatenate multiple data parts into UID when needed

**Reason**: When `GetBinDays` requires multiple pieces of data (UPRN, property name, coordinates, etc.), concatenate them into the `Uid` field using a semicolon separator. This allows you to pass all necessary data forward without re-fetching addresses in both `GetAddresses` and `GetBinDays`.

**This pattern is far preferable to re-fetching the same address data in both methods.**

**Pattern:**

1. In `GetAddresses`: Concatenate all required data into the UID
2. In `GetBinDays`: Split the UID to extract the individual parts

**Example (WakefieldCouncil):**

```c#
// In GetAddresses - concatenate uprn and property
var address = new Address
{
    Property = property,
    Postcode = postcode,
    Uid = $"{uprn};{property}",  // Store multiple values
};
```

```c#
// In GetBinDays - split and use the parts
// Uid format: "uprn;property"
var parts = address.Uid!.Split(';', 2);
var uprn = parts[0];
var property = parts[1];

var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
{
    Url = $"https://example.com/bins?uprn={uprn}&a={property}",
    // ...
};
```

**Important notes:**

- Use semicolon (`;`) as the separator to avoid conflicts with common address characters (commas, spaces)
- Use `Split(';', 2)` when you only need to split into a specific number of parts
- Always use the null-forgiving operator when splitting: `address.Uid!.Split(';')`
- Document the UID format with a comment in both methods for clarity

### ⚠️ WARNING: Changing UID format is a breaking change for existing users

**Reason**: The mobile app caches addresses client-side with no guaranteed expiry. If a collector's UID format changes (e.g. when migrating to a new council API), existing users will submit the old UID format to `GetBinDays` indefinitely — not just until the server-side cache expires.

**When a UID format change is unavoidable**, add backwards-compatible handling in `GetBinDays` to detect and resolve the old format:

1. Detect the old format by inspecting the UID (e.g. `address.Uid!.Contains(':')` for a colon-delimited legacy ID)
2. Add a separate code path that resolves the old UID to the new format (e.g. by re-fetching addresses and matching by index)
3. Mark it with a `// TODO: Remove once legacy UIDs are no longer in circulation` comment — but note that removal may not be safe if addresses are cached client-side indefinitely

```c#
public GetBinDaysResponse GetBinDays(Address address, ClientSideResponse? clientSideResponse)
{
    // TODO: Remove once legacy UIDs are no longer in circulation.
    // Addresses cached before the API migration use the old CTRL:63:_:D:N format.
    if (address.Uid!.Contains(':'))
    {
        return GetLegacyBinDays(address, clientSideResponse);
    }

    // Normal path using new UPRN-based UIDs
    // ...
}
```

---

## GetBinDays Patterns

### ❌ DON'T: Re-fetch address data in GetBinDays

**Problem**: Repeating the address lookup logic when you already have the address data.

```c#
public GetBinDaysResponse GetBinDays(Address address, ClientSideResponse? clientSideResponse)
{
    if (clientSideResponse == null)
    {
        // ❌ Re-fetching address data using address.Postcode and address.Uid
        var requestBody = $$"""
        {
            "postcode": "{{address.Postcode}}",
            "action": "searchAddress"
        }
        """;

        var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
        {
            RequestId = 1,
            Url = "https://api.example.com/addressLookup",  // ❌ Same as GetAddresses
            Method = "POST",
            Body = requestBody,
        };
    }
}
```

### ✅ DO: Use the address data you already have

**Reason**: The `Address` object already contains all the data you need (Uid, Property, Postcode). Use it directly.

```c#
public GetBinDaysResponse GetBinDays(Address address, ClientSideResponse? clientSideResponse)
{
    if (clientSideResponse == null)
    {
        // ✅ Use address.Uid directly for bin days lookup
        var requestBody = $$"""
        {
            "uprn": "{{address.Uid}}",
            "action": "getBinDays"
        }
        """;

        var clientSideRequest = new ClientSideRequest
        {
            RequestId = 1,
            Url = "https://api.example.com/binDays",  // ✅ Different endpoint
            Method = "POST",
            Body = requestBody,
        };
    }
}
```

**When is re-fetching acceptable?**

Only if the API strictly requires it (e.g. session initialization for both endpoints). Even then, consider if the session can be reused from GetAddresses.

## Iteration Patterns

### ❌ DON'T: Forget iteration comments

**Problem**: Missing the standard comment before foreach loops.

```c#
var addresses = new List<Address>();
foreach (Match match in rawAddresses)  // ❌ No comment
{
    // ...
}
```

### ✅ DO: Add standard iteration comments

**Reason**: Improves readability and follows project conventions.

```c#
// Iterate through each address, and create a new address object
var addresses = new List<Address>();
foreach (Match match in rawAddresses)
{
    // ...
}
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use List.Any() for deduplication checks

**Problem**: Inefficient O(n) check on each iteration.

```c#
var bins = new List<BinInfo>();

foreach (var row in rowsData.EnumerateObject())
{
    var serviceItemId = row.Value.GetProperty("ServiceItemID").GetString()!;

    if (bins.Any(b => b.ServiceItemId == serviceItemId))  // ❌ O(n) each time
    {
        continue;
    }

    bins.Add(new BinInfo { ServiceItemId = serviceItemId });
}
```

### ✅ DO: Use HashSet for deduplication

**Reason**: O(1) lookup performance.

```c#
var bins = new List<BinInfo>();
var seenServiceItemIds = new HashSet<string>();

foreach (var row in rowsData.EnumerateObject())
{
    var serviceItemId = row.Value.GetProperty("ServiceItemID").GetString()!;

    if (!seenServiceItemIds.Add(serviceItemId))  // ✅ O(1) and adds in one step
    {
        continue;
    }

    bins.Add(new BinInfo { ServiceItemId = serviceItemId });
}
```

### ❌ DON'T: Use .ToList().AsReadOnly()

**Problem**: Old pattern for creating readonly collections.

```c#
Addresses = addresses.ToList().AsReadOnly(),
```

### ✅ DO: Use collection expressions

**Reason**: Modern C# 12 syntax is more concise.

```c#
Addresses = [.. addresses],
```

---

## URL Query Parameters

### ❌ DON'T: Include unnecessary query parameters in URLs

**Problem**: Copying all query parameters from browser network traffic, including empty, default, or null-like values.

```c#
Url = $"{baseUrl}/apibroker/runLookup?id=56a1f135c2a43&repeat_against=&noRetry=false&getOnlyTokens=undefined&log_id=&app_name=AF-Renderer::Self&_={DateTimeOffset.UtcNow.ToUnixTimeMilliseconds()}&sid={sessionId}",
```

### ✅ DO: Strip query parameters to the minimum required set

**Reason**: Most query parameters copied from browser traffic are not required. Empty values (`repeat_against=`), defaults (`noRetry=false`), null-like values (`getOnlyTokens=undefined`), cache-busters (`_=`), and analytics/logging parameters (`log_id=`, `app_name=`) are almost never needed.

```c#
Url = $"{baseUrl}/apibroker/runLookup?id=56a1f135c2a43",
```

**Strategy:** Remove all query parameters except the obvious identifiers, then add back only those that cause test failures when missing. Parameters that are good candidates for removal:

- Empty values: `param=`
- Default/false values: `noRetry=false`
- Null-like values: `param=undefined`, `param=null`
- Cache-busters: `_=1234567890`
- Logging/analytics: `log_id=`, `app_name=`
- Session IDs in query strings (often only needed in cookies)

---

## URL Encoding

### ❌ DON'T: Manually URL encode values

**Problem**: Using `WebUtility.UrlEncode` or manually encoding characters.

```c#
using System.Net;

var encodedPostcode = WebUtility.UrlEncode(postcode);  // ❌ Don't do this
var url = $"https://api.example.com?postcode={encodedPostcode}";

// Or manually replacing characters
var encodedValue = value.Replace(" ", "%20").Replace("&", "%26");  // ❌ Don't do this
```

### ✅ DO: Let the framework handle encoding

**Reason**: String interpolation in URLs and the Uri constructor handle encoding automatically.

```c#
// ✅ Just use the value directly
var url = $"https://api.example.com?postcode={postcode}";
var uri = new Uri(url);  // Uri constructor handles encoding

// ✅ In request bodies (JSON), values are automatically encoded
var body = $$"""
{
    "postcode": "{{postcode}}",
    "address": "{{address}}"
}
""";
```

**When manual encoding IS needed (rare):**

Only when an API explicitly requires pre-encoded values in a non-standard way. Always document why in a comment.

### Example Vendor Base Collector Template (ITouchVisionCollectorBase)

For collectors using shared vendor platforms:

```c#
namespace BinDays.Api.Collectors.Collectors.Councils;

using BinDays.Api.Collectors.Collectors.Vendors;
using BinDays.Api.Collectors.Models;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

/// <summary>
/// Collector implementation for My Vendor Council.
/// </summary>
internal sealed class MyVendorCouncil : ITouchVisionCollectorBase, ICollector
{
	/// <inheritdoc/>
	public string Name => "My Vendor Council";

	/// <inheritdoc/>
	public Uri WebsiteUrl => new("https://www.myvendorcouncil.gov.uk/");

	/// <inheritdoc/>
	public override string GovUkId => "my-vendor-council";

	/// <inheritdoc/>
	protected override int ClientId => 123;

	/// <inheritdoc/>
	protected override int CouncilId => 45678;

	/// <inheritdoc/>
	protected override string ApiBaseUrl => "https://iweb.itouchvision.com/portal/itouchvision/";

	/// <inheritdoc/>
	protected override IReadOnlyCollection<Bin> BinTypes =>
	[
		new()
		{
			Name = "General Waste",
			Colour = BinColour.Black,
			Keys = [ "Rubbish" ],
		},
		new()
		{
			Name = "Recycling",
			Colour = BinColour.Blue,
			Keys = [ "Recycling" ],
		},
		new()
		{
			Name = "Garden Waste",
			Colour = BinColour.Brown,
			Keys = [ "Garden Waste" ],
		},
	];
}
```

**Note**: No `GetAddresses()` or `GetBinDays()` methods—handled by the base class. Class is `sealed` but **not** `partial` (no regex methods).

## Testing Requirements

### Integration Tests

- **Requirement**: Every new collector **must** have an accompanying integration test
- **Test Helper**: Use the `TestSteps.EndToEnd` helper for end-to-end testing
- **Test Naming**: Test methods should be named descriptively (e.g. `GetBinDaysTest`)
- **Test File Location**: `BinDays.Api.IntegrationTests/Collectors/Councils/[CollectorName]Tests.cs`

### Example Integration Test Template

```c#
namespace BinDays.Api.IntegrationTests.Collectors.Councils;

using BinDays.Api.Collectors.Collectors.Councils;
using BinDays.Api.IntegrationTests.Helpers;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Xunit;
using Xunit.Abstractions;

public class MyNewCouncilTests
{
	private readonly IntegrationTestClient _client;
	private readonly ITestOutputHelper _outputHelper;
	private static readonly string _govUkId = new MyNewCouncil().GovUkId;

	public MyNewCouncilTests(ITestOutputHelper outputHelper)
	{
		_outputHelper = outputHelper;
		_client = new IntegrationTestClient(outputHelper);
	}

	[Theory]
	[InlineData("ABCD EFG")]
	public async Task GetBinDaysTest(string postcode)
	{
		await TestSteps.EndToEnd(
			_client,
			postcode,
			_govUkId,
			_outputHelper
		);
	}
}
```

## Quick Reference Checklist

Before submitting a PR, check:

**Structure:**

- [ ] File in correct directory (`Collectors/Councils/`)
- [ ] Class name matches filename
- [ ] `internal sealed` (add `partial` only if using `[GeneratedRegex]`)
- [ ] Integration test created in `IntegrationTests/Collectors/Councils/`

**HTTP & Requests:**

- [ ] HTTP headers are minimal (typically just `content-type` where needed; `user-agent` is the default and only needed explicitly when other headers are also set)
- [ ] Use `Constants.FormUrlEncoded`, `Constants.ApplicationJson`, `Constants.XmlHttpRequest` instead of string literals
- [ ] Omit `Headers` entirely for simple GET requests (default provides user-agent)
- [ ] Request bodies contain only required fields (no empty/null/default/false values)
- [ ] Use raw string literals for JSON, not nested dictionaries
- [ ] Use `new()` for dictionaries, not `new Dictionary<string, string>()`
- [ ] Use HTTPS URLs when available

**Bin Configuration:**

- [ ] Bin names are descriptive (what goes in, not just color/type)
- [ ] Bin type keys include only what's actually matched
- [ ] No bin names extracted as constants
- [ ] No explicit `Type = BinType.Bin` (it's the default)
- [ ] Bin types declared before const fields in configuration section

**Data Handling:**

- [ ] Postcode is NOT formatted in collector (it comes pre-formatted)
- [ ] Postcode NOT extracted from address data - use parameter
- [ ] Metadata contains only values needed in subsequent requests
- [ ] No explicit empty metadata initialization
- [ ] Required values use null-forgiving operator (`!`) not null-coalescing (`??`)
- [ ] Headers accessed with direct indexer for required headers
- [ ] JSON properties use `GetString()!` for required values
- [ ] No URL encoding - let framework handle it automatically
- [ ] No unnecessary query parameters in URLs (empty values, defaults, cache-busters, logging params)

**Code Style:**

- [ ] All multi-line initializers have trailing commas
- [ ] Date parsing uses multi-line format
- [ ] Closing parenthesis on separate line for multi-line calls
- [ ] No unused using statements (especially System.Web, System.Linq if not used)
- [ ] No inline returns - use separate variable declarations
- [ ] `partial` keyword only for classes with `[GeneratedRegex]`

**Regex:**

- [ ] Use named capture groups, access by name not index
- [ ] Use null-forgiving operator `!` on `Matches()` calls
- [ ] No unused `[GeneratedRegex]` methods
- [ ] Use `[GeneratedRegex]` for all patterns - no `Regex.Match/Replace` with strings

**Complexity & Structure:**

- [ ] Collector is under 500 lines (ideally 200-400)
- [ ] No unnecessary retry logic or over-engineering
- [ ] No defensive fallbacks for cases that shouldn't occur
- [ ] All request body fields verified as required (tested by removal)
- [ ] All request steps verified as required (no redundant token/data fetch steps)
- [ ] URL query parameters stripped to minimum required set

**GetBinDays:**

- [ ] Don't re-fetch address data - use `address.Uid` directly
- [ ] Only re-fetch if API strictly requires it (document why)

**Helpers & Patterns:**

- [ ] No single-use helper methods
- [ ] No local functions (methods inside methods) — use loops instead
- [ ] All if statements use braces (no single-line `if (...) return;`)
- [ ] All helper methods have XML documentation
- [ ] All private fields, const fields, and regex methods have XML documentation
- [ ] Duplicate logic (2-3+ uses) extracted to helpers
- [ ] Standard iteration comment before foreach loops
- [ ] Use HashSet for deduplication, not `List.Any()`
- [ ] Use collection expressions `[.. collection]`, not `.ToList().AsReadOnly()`

**Constants:**

- [ ] No constants for single-use values
- [ ] Constants only for values used 2+ times

**Address:**

- [ ] Use `string.Join` with `Where` for address building, not if statements
- [ ] Use switch expressions, not nested ternary operators
- [ ] Don't split addresses into Street/Town unless API requires it
- [ ] Don't sort addresses - return in order received
- [ ] Trim all related values consistently
- [ ] Concatenate multiple data parts into UID using semicolon (`;`) separator when GetBinDays needs multiple values
- [ ] Split UID with `address.Uid!.Split(';')` in GetBinDays to extract the parts
- [ ] Document UID format with comments when using concatenation

---

## Summary

The key principle behind these patterns is: **Keep collectors simple, minimal, and intentionally brittle**.

- Use the minimum necessary code
- Let failures happen loudly and clearly
- Don't add defensive logic for cases that shouldn't occur
- Only extract/abstract when there's genuine duplication (2-3+ uses)
- Follow modern C# conventions (collection expressions, target-typed new, etc.)
- Be consistent (trailing commas, trimming, formatting)
- Target 200-400 lines per collector

When in doubt, look at existing approved collectors for reference patterns.
